# Kata Roman numbers

We had the chance to try for an hour this kata in the Wecodefest 2019 in Mod mode.
We didn't have time to finish it, so I decided to do it by myself.

I have am going to reproduce the steps we did during the kata and then I will try to continue by
myself.

Restriction: Consider 1000 as the maximum number.

## By myself
I did several iterations till I've got blocked when I added 99 to the tests.
I have created the branch [by-myself](https://github.com/cesarob/kata-wecodefest-roman-numbers/tree/by-myself) as I am going some iterations in order to implement a proper solution.

## Final solution
I checked [this one](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/Katas/tree/master/Exercism.io/python/roman-numerals), and I iterated mine in order to match it. I don't like to have hardcoded the roman values
for 4, 9, 40, 90, 400 and 900 but it works.
